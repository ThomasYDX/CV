        <h1><a href="https://www.facebook.com/thomas.silentassassin/">Thomas Xie</a></h1>
        <p><em><strong>Founder</strong> and CEO of <strong>Galaxie Productions</strong>.</em></p>

        <p>Born in Paris, but moved around a lot due to my father’s expatriate status. Cities I lived in include, Paris, Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai. <br>I am trilingual, my first language is English but I’m fluent in Chinese and proficient in
          French. Travelled to 46 countries by the age of 18. <br>Graduated from Beijing Film Academy working with a B.F.A. in Film and Television Management. During my time in Beijing i've been fortunate enough to work with some of major players in the Chinese Film industry. I aspire to use my multicultural background <br>to help bridge the Chinese, American and
          European film industries.</p>

        <p>出生于法国，因为父母工作的缘故，本人一直生活与香港、北京和上海之间。母语为英文，同时亦通晓中文与法文。<br>本人毕业于北京电影学院管理系，主攻影视制作，计划在大学毕业后到洛杉矶或纽约继续深造，以期成为一名具有<br>中美法三重文化的制片人。
